We explained everything that had been ocurring. He was very questionable about exactly what was occuring. He examined him and recommended we take him to a Pediatric Neurologist. He also ordered an immediate blood work-up. They tested him for many substances such as lead, chromium etc. Everything came out clear. He set us up with a neurologist. He said he couldn't see our son for over a month. We were extremely distraught. We argued over the severity of what was occuring. They said it was the best they could do. So we waited. Over this period of time our son deteriorated severly. He continued twitching, jerking, spasming. He could not even walk without falling. He lost his entire memory. He was like he was in a delierium. He would just sit and stare at a blank wall. He no longer recognized anything or anyone around him. He began urinating and soiling himself on a regular basis. He basically became like a vegatable. We called the doctor and pleaded for help. We were told we must wait. That there were other sick children too. This was the most horrible, stressful, sad experience in our lives. Our son could no longer talk at all. he had no memory of anything including his father and I. He had no potty training abilities. He had no co-ordination. He could barely walk. He would just sit and stare with his mouth open. After about 3 continuous weeks of twitiching it stopped. But his condition had no improvement. He became terrifed of anything. Screaming and crying uncontrollably. After about a week wait we finally got him to the neurologist. Upon him seeing and hearing our son. He says ""why was this child not brought to my attention much sooner."" We nearly went into hysterics. Explaining all we had been through and how hard we tried to get him in. He became upset and said he wished to speak to our sons pediatrition. So we agreed. He spoke to the doctor about him recognizing this as a DPT reaction. Why was this not brought to his attention sooner to begin treatment. Our sons pediatrition; said he just wasn't sure about the DPT reaction. He said he had observed some abnormal behaviors in our son before immunization; he thought it might relate to. We found this comment rude, offensive and a deliberate move to try and cover his huge mistakes. He had never brought any concerns about our son to our attention ever. He was his pediatrition since birth. He always commended us on his growth and advancements. Nothing but positive remarks. To hear this was infuriating. The neurologist asked for immediate admittance into the hospital. We agreed to this. He was admitted to the hospital. They did an MRI and a Spinal Tap. Both of the tests came back normal. The Neurologist said that our son had aquired an aphasia for a reason still unknown. So we should get an EEG The EEg should be sleeping. This was a problem because since all this occurred our son had become extremly hyper-active, rarely sleeping, he had constant laughing seizures which lasted for up to 3 hours. He was uncontrollable. We still tried the EEG. We could not get him to settle much less sleep for the test. The results were not showing seizure activity. The neurologist recommended taking him to a psycologist for evaluation. We agreed and upon doing so both evaluations brought up a possiblity of him aquiring a rare condition called Landau Kleffner Syndrome. They believed he was still having sub-clinical seziures. Which was causing the strange behaviors now occuring hyper-activity, social withdrawl, aggressiveness, depression etc. We felt it was because of the complete loss of speech and language and memory. That caused such tremdous frustration.

Following the second innoculation, his speech did not regress further; however, his behavior changed and became significantly more of a concern.

The mercury included in thimerosal laden products and power plant emissions together caused the pt to suffer from serious and permanent neurological injuries. The pt was exposed to airborne mercury vapor and mercury through food chain. The exposure to airborne mercury in the environment through inhalation, the food chain, and other sources contributed to the cumulative mercury toxicity and was a substantial factor in causing his neurological damage. it was noted that the pt had a heightened vulnerability to suffer neurological injuries from industrial mercury as a direct result of thimerosal exposure. As a direct and proximate cause of the toxic mercury exposure to  the pt, minor male was caused to suffer serious and permanent neurological damage which included past and future mental, intellectual, development and neurological incapacity and associated learning disabilities, disorders and impairments. Additional information has been received from medical records concerning an approx 18 month old male with a history of clonus, increased reflexes and hospitalization due to dehydration who on 7/18/1991 and 9/26/1991 was vaccinated with the first and second dosed, respectively of Hib conj vaccine 3rd dose given 6/26/1992 and 4 dose given 11/1/1999. Concomitant vaccinations included the first and second doses, respectively of DPT (3rd dose given 1/26/1992), In approx Nov 1992, the pt was diagnosed with autism as his language decreased and be came unintelligible. His development was slowing in general. He was difficult to handle due to over activity and preservation behavior. On 12/16/1993, the pt was seen by a developmental pediatrician. At that time, the pts mother was concerned he could not talk, She noted he had several words, but quit talking around two years of age. This was the only loss of skills that the mother noticed. At the time of examination, he had no words although he had some immature jargoning. His overall functioning was at the 7-9 month range with characteristics of pervasive developmental disorder (PPD) noted as well as overall development delays in the mental retardation range with language skills being much lower than non language skills. A diagnosis of PPD NOS and moderate mental retardation was made. He did have some temper tantrums which took about 20 minutes to subside. On 11/9/1998, the pt was again seen by a developmental pediatrician. At that time, his mother noted that his nerves were rally bad and that he did not keep still. The pt was being treated with Ritalin. On examination, the pt was noted to be a well nourished, generally uncooperative male in no acute distress. He was preserverative. He speech showed fair to poor intelligibility. He spoke in few words to complete sentences. He had a short attention span. hyperactive and at times attention seeking. He frequently walked on his toes, was echolalic and rock and bit his nails. The pt was fairly non compliant, was inconsistent in identifying number concepts, could not identify shapes and could not draw a cross or square. A diagnosis of autism, ADHD and behavioral problems with non compliance was made. As of 4/3/01, the pt had widely variable ability, ranging from mild to moderate mental retardation to the low average range.

In approx Oct 1989, the pt was noted to have speech delay as he was no longer saying distinct words and could only be heard to utter jargon in a sing song manner. He was also noted to have stopped developing. In approx April 1990, a diagnosis of autism was made. on 5/10/1992 the pt was hospitalized in a pediatric ward for reactive air way disease, developmental delays and to rule out pervasive developmental delay. At that time, the pt was noted to have poor speech with a vocabulary of approx 15 words. He was evaluated by a developmental pediatrician who noted that the pt appeared to be showing very stereotypical behavior consistent with Pervasive developmental delay (PPD), in particular, autism, The physician noted that the pt had a severe verbal and non verbal communication disorder with some deviant social interactions. In additional, the pt had chromosomes which were also sent for fragile X, which were negative, High resolution chromosomes that were done revealed that the pt was a 46 xy normal male by chromosome appearance. The pt also had a normal EEG and audiological evaluation. A speech evaluation concluded that the pt had a severe speech delay pattern. Discharge diagnosis included PPD, probably moderate to severe mental retardation and reactive airway disease. On 7/10/1992, the pt was seen by a developmental pediatrician who confirmed a diagnosis of PPD, but was unclear of the specific etiology of the pts developmental difficulties. On 9/15/1992 and MRI of the brain was normal. On 3/19/2001, the pt developed a seizure disorder for which he was hospitalized.

It was reported by the pts parents that he had been diagnosed with ADHD and possibly depression, he was started on Ritalin which was discontinued after one day because the pts behaviors were exacerbated on it. The pts parents also reported that he had difficulty with the demands of a structured preschool setting, and difficulty in understanding how to play with other children, the pt achieved developmental milestones which were generally within normal limits, with the exception of his language milestones, and he has no set and regular schedule for sleep. The pts family history is significant for learning difficulties on his mothers side and depression and alcohol abuse in his paternal family. The pts half brother from his maternal side is reported to have ADHD. It was observed during the evaluation that the pts attention was greatly diminished with tasks beyond his level of understanding, though he was very pleased with success, smiling and clapping when able to complete tasks. it was noted that the pts cooperation was better when sitting closer to his father. It was observed that the pt had a low frustration tolerance and difficulty calming himself once he became frustrated, he communicated this in non verbal and simple verbal ways.

In additional, the pt was exposed to mercury from continually inhaling and ingesting industry mercury emissions from fossil fuel driven power plants. The mercury included in thimerosal laden products and power plant emissions together caused the pt to suffer from serious and permanent neurological injuries. The pt was exposed to airborne mercury vapor and mercury through food chain. The exposure to airborne mercury in the environment through inhalation, the food chain, and other sources contributed to the cumulative mercury toxicity and was a substantial factor in causing his neurological damage. it was noted that the pt had a heightened vulnerability to suffer neurological injuries from industrial mercury as a direct result of thimerosal exposure. As a direct and proximate cause of the toxic mercury exposure to  the pt, minor male was caused to suffer serious and permanent neurological damage which included past and future mental, intellectual, development and neurological incapacity and associated learning disabilities, disorders and impairments. Follow up information has been received from medical records concerning a 20 month old male whose mother toxaemia during pregnancy and who has a history chickenpox, colic, URI, gastroenteritis, GERD, hospitalisation for right inguinal hernia, slight obesity, otitis serious, allergic rhinitis, and a family history of diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disorder, kidney failure, and epilepsy who vaccinated with a first and second dose of MMR II on 5/22/1992 and 8/22/1995. Concomitant vaccination on 8/22/1995 included fifth dose of DPT, a fourth dose of Polio virus vaccine and a third dose of PPD. Illness at the time of vaccination included tinea capitis. On 4/28/1994 the pt was seen for a psychological evaluation and was diagnosed with hyperactivity, oppositional defiant behavior, language delay and separation anxiety. On 4/24/1996 the pt was considered to be a child who had a non progressive encephalopathy due to some type of organic brain problem. On 5/10/1996 the pot underwent an MRI of the brain which was normal. On 11/24/1999 the pt was diagnosed with Autism and was treated with Prozac 1.5 cc every morning and Ritalin 1/2 tablet in the morning for one week than 1 tablet every morning and one in the afternoon. On 11/1/1999 it was noted the the pt had been diagnosed with pervasive developmental delays and ADHD. It was noted that he had a history of seizures starting in 1995. On 11/01/99 the pt was seen for a central auditory test. The results were consistent with a significant auditory processing disorder. On 4/3/01 it was noted that the pt was treated with Paxil 10 mg daily. On 2/4/02 it was noted that the pt was currently on therapy with Zoloft. On 3/27/02 the pt was seen in the neurology clinic. It was reported that the pt could not be clearly diagnosed as having wither Asperger syndrome or high functioning autism. The central auditory features were typical of Asperger syndrome. The language delay was more constant with high functioning autism. It was noted that he may fall in the gray zone between the two diagnoses. It was noted that he was on therapy with Zoloft 50 mg QHS and Melatonin 3 mg (which discontinued after this visit). On 5/17/04 the pt was seen in follow up at the neurology clinic for autism, apparently high functioning.

The subject was vaccinated with Engerix B on 23 September 1992, 02 November 1992, and 30 March 1993. On 30 March 1993 the subject received third dose of Engerix B. According to the legal complaint, at an unspecified time after vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine, the subject experienced ""serious and permanent neurological injuries"" which were ""alleged to be caused by Thimerosal."" Additionally, the subject experienced a neurodevelopmental disorder. Approximately two years after the third vaccination with Engerix B, in December 1995, the subject was diagnosed with autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. In December 1996, a diagnosis of autism was again made. In April 1998, the subject was diagnosed with mental retardation and mixed receptive-expressive language disorder. This case was assessed as medically serious by manufacturer. The following information was received on 30 March 2007 via medical records. In November 1994, the subject's pediatrician noted he exhibited a limited vocabulary for his age and had not started putting words together. According to pediatrician's notes dated 27 September 1995, the subject had been recently diagnosed with pervasive developmental disorder, and was enrolled in speech therapy at that time. He was later diagnosed with autism. On 04 December 1995, the subject underwent a comprehensive developmental pediatric evaluation. According to his mother, the subject rolled over at three months, and crawled and walked alone at 10 months. He reportedly had a ""social smile at one month, said ""mama"" at 7 months, and then it went away"". Concerns at the time of examination included short attention span and occasional aggression. Examination revealed normal extremity strength and tone. The subject was found to meet the diagnostic criteria for autism. On 06 December 1995, he underwent a psychological evaluation for problems including poor language skills and inability to initiate toilet training. Cognitive development as assessed by the Bayley Scales of Infant Development fell within the ""significantly delayed performance range of functioning"". Diagnoses included autistic disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD, predominantly hyperactive-impulsive disorder). Moderate psychosocial stressors were also noted, including problems with primary support group and inadequate educational services. A speech and language evaluation was conducted on 17 June 1996 for possible school placement. According to the speech pathologist's report, the subject exhibited language understanding at 6 to 7 month level with some skills scattered to 11 to 12 months, and expressive language skills at a 3 to 4 month level. On 31 December 1996 a developmental neuropsychosocial evaluation was conducted, resulting in confirmation of a diagnosis of autism. Receptive language skills were assessed at the 12 to 17 month level, with expressive language skills at approximately a 10 month level. The evaluating psychologist stated ""the extent of autistic behaviors is sufficiently severe to render impossible any efforts at estimating nonverbal intellectual skills"". On 20 March 1997, the subject was evaluated by a neurologist who confirmed autism with severe difficulty with language, and initiated a trial of dextromethorphan. Prozac was initiated on 21 May 1997, and upon follow up on 23 July 1997, it was noted that the subject was experiencing increased focus and eye contact. A taper from dextromethorphan was started at that time. On 17 November 1997, a pediatric neurologist expressed the impression of pervasive developmental disability compatible with autism, stating "" I find no other neurologic abnormality and did not feel that any further psychosocial testing needs to be performed.""

Notes indicated ""rule out speech delay, rule out hearing loss"". On 26 June 1998, a speech and language evaluation was conducted. results included mild delays in auditory comprehension, receptive language, expressive language, and total language with normal expressive communication skills. It was noted that the subject yelled or engaged in aggressive behavior instead of using language when frustrated. Recommendations included weekly speech therapy. On 02 July 1998, the subject underwent a developmental evaluation within the home, and demonstrated significantly delayed mental skills for his age, with language, cognitive, fine motor, sensory processing, and attending skills of specific concern. It was noted that he experienced difficulty attending to tasks and became easily frustrated. Recommendations included speech intervention and occupational and developmental therapy. An occupational therapy evaluation revealed slightly low muscle tone in the trunk and upper and lower extremities, and concerns included sensory processing and hand-eye coordination which were assessed to be ""influencing the development of age appropriate sensory motor skills"". According to progress notes dated 23 July 1998, the subject had been identified as having a speech delay by his daycare provider. In May 1999, the subject was referred for review and update of developmental assessments. Developmental testing revealed a significant mental delay with relative strengths in nonverbal problem solving/ reasoning, while tasks involving verbal comprehensive and expressive language were more difficult. The evaluated stated that ""at this point, the special education category of autism is appropriate for (subject)"". On 09 June 1999, the subject returned to his pediatrician for evaluation for evaluation of unclear speech described as ""somewhat of a speech impediment"". At that time, the subject was enrolled in speech therapy. A psychological consultation was performed on 21 July 1999 for the purpose of educational placement. He exhibited oppositional behavior at times, and was noted to initiate joint attention with adults, although he did not do so with peers. Evaluation on 23 November 1999 indicated ""loss of many developmental milestones especially expressive language"", and during the course of examination the subject was ""chaotic"" and inattention. The subject struck his mother and the examining physician several times, and attempts to control the child resulted in ""explosive behavior from the child with screaming and spitting at mother"". The evaluating physician also observed that ""lack of continuity had contributed greatly to the chaotic nature of this patient's medical record"", and recommended that the subject be assigned a single pediatric provider.

We saw no language and bazaar behaviors, sleep problems, PICA (mainly eating paper products and outdoor items, leaves, limbs, dirt, etc.) patient also had 2 heat related seizures while on Augmentin.  He has not had any since taking him off Augmentin.  Patient was put on Miralax for constipation.  He no longer takes this, but he still has some difficulty with stools (sometimes very large). Most of his life until probably the last 6 months we as parents had to make him go to the bathroom to have a bowel movement (we did this every night).  We recently took him off the Miralax and he will usually go by himself without telling him to go.  We have had numerous problems with patient.  Over the years the behaviors have been very severe.  He has broken windows, furniture etc.)  We find it very hard to find people who will work with him because of his behaviors.  A little over 5 years ago we started going to a Defeat Autism Now (DAN) doctor.  We now go to him about once every year or two depending on how patient is doing.  He has put patient on a number of vitamins and supplements and treatments.  Patient seems to be doing better, but we still have outbursts.  Just recently he broke the front window in my Wolkswagen with his hand.   We believe patient has severe headaches.  He is also self abusive (bites his arm and hand).  Hits his head. Over the years patient has been treated by Dr.  He is no longer in practice.  We then went to Dr., Peditrician.  He now practices in a different city, but we still go to him presently.

Patient tx w/hyperbarics, gluten/caesin free diet, chelation, multiple meds & supplements, NIMH protocol, ST/OT. FINAL DX: autism, pervasive developmental disorder. Per 60 day follow up: He is severly austistic.  Follow-up: Gluten Free/Casein Free diet prescribed by Dr. Vitamins and supplements prescribed by Dr. Previously was on MIRALAX for quite a number of years for constipation. He no longer takes this, but he still has some difficulty with stools (sometimes very large). We feel he was unable to feel when he needed to go to the bathroom for a bowel movement while on MIRALAX, because since he has been off he sometimes goes on his own in the toilet. He never went on his own while on MIRALAX we had to make him go, unless he went on the floor. We make sure he goes at least once a day. Pt is allergic to AUGMENTIN, we found this out after he had two heat related seizures while on this medication when he was younger. Pt also had a hernia operation around 2 years of age. Follow-up: Patient is severely autistic with major deficits in language and social skills. We have seen major behavior problems over the years, but over the last few years we have seen more violent behaviors including kicking and punching out (with his fists) sheet rock walls, glass windows including all 3 window shields in our cars.

A Special Masters ruled a petition alleging that thimerosal in vaccines, including the RECOMBIVAX vaccine (manufacturer unknown), caused attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), saying symptoms that may not have been recognized at the time still trigger the Vaccine Act's 36-month statue of limitations. A Chief Special Master said that the experts agreed that the ""first symptoms of manifestations"" of the patient's ADHD was at the latest by 03-Nov-2001 when he was 4 years and 6 months old, which required a filing by 03-Nov-2004, under the statue. The Chief Special Master noted that the binding decision regarding onset timing, allows ""retrospective"" analysis even when such analysis identifies as the ""first symptoms or manifestations"" some innocuous episode in a child's health. The chief special master pointed out, the manifestation was ""blinking."" The undersigned disagrees with the petitioner's interpretation and finds that the correct reading is that the critical determination is focused solely upon when the first symptoms or manifestation of onset occurred. Chief Special Master said ""whether this determination can be made contemporaneously with the symptoms first occurred or in hindsight utilizing the injured's complete medical record is irrelevant, as long as the determination was made utilizing the 'recognized standards of the medical profession at large.

After the 4 month vaccines (12/23/08), similar things took place, however, there was not a seizure episode that I can recall.  But she continued to become less interactive (would not respond to a loud blender 2 feet from her, sit quietly in bath chair for an hour, not react to play with siblings), bloated, allergy and infectious symptoms (but never spiked a high fever).

He received the DTap, HepB, IPV, HIB, Pneumococcal and Rotavirus vaccines all in the same day.  He had prolonged jaundice that developed immediately after his Hepatitis B vaccine in the hospital (at birth) as well.  Following these vaccines at 4.5 months old, my son could no longer bear weight on his legs, did not scooch around his crib, lost all early babbling, could not latch onto my breast to eat, would not look us in the eye, and began to lose weight.  His one eye turned in and tracking did not seem normal anymore.  I took him into a pediatric eye doctor to have his eyes checked.  He had no vision problems, but did not look at us.  He developed severe sensory problems where we could not hold him close, he did not want to touch any items and his hands stayed balled up in fists next to his ears.  He could not tolerate eating or drinking and I had to syringe formula down his mouth.  He developed severe GI problems, where he would stool liquid burning diahrrea 10 or more times per day.  He threw up constantly.  He became obsessed with paper and door springs and wheels.  I immediately sought out a lactation consultant and nutritionist for my son, and rented a hospital grade pump, but he was no longer able to be close to me or latch on correctly to nurse.  The GI doctor put patient on a special formula and Prevacid to help with ""reflux"" which did not help.  A couple months went by and we tried to introduce solids to my son, which he refused to eat.  He shook his head violently side to side.  We then were referred to facility for an evaluation for feeding therapy and an evaluation for Occupational Therapy as well at 8 months old.  He was diagnosed with Sensory Processing Disorder and we began feeding and occupational therapy twice each week.  Feeding did not get better, GI did not get better and my son only grew in his sensory problems.  As he got older more and more obsessions appeared and he became more and more disconnected from us.  He developed dark circles under his eyes and drooled excessively, soaking through shirts in a matter of minutes.  He was obsessed with wheels, spinning himself and banging his head on the walls. He did not look us in the eye.  The formerly very social child we had brought into this world was gone.  Formula had to be syringed down my son, who had to sit in a vibrating baby chair with video for distraction to syringe his formula down his mouth without him batting it away or shaking his head violently.  Each bottle took us approx 2 hours to get down, 5 times per day.  Solids were an even worse undertaking with crying, fighting, etc.  At 10 months old, I reached out for more in home occupational therapy as my son had a horrible time going to the feeding and OT at the clinic due to sensory problems.  At 11 months old, we took my son to a Holistic Pediatrician as his original Pediatrician stopped taking our insurance a few months prior.  This doctor specialized in children with ADHD, Autism, Autoimmune issues and Allergies which I highly suspected were a problem now.  We reported what had occurred with our son to our new Pediatrician.  He ran some tests and determined that patient now had all kinds of imbalances, an over growth of yeast, vitamin and mineral deficiencies that needed to be treated.  This helped our son immensely.  We switched formulas to a gluten and casein free type and this helped as well.  When we took the labs to our current local GI doctor from Dr showing all the GI overgrowths and problems, we were dismissed by our local GI.  My son was also tested for MTHFR mutation, which he did have, as do many on the spectrum.  I have the same mutation, but am not autistic.  He has a decreased ability to excrete toxins and should never have been given so many vaccines at one time.

I immediately took a Benadryl, knowing the feeling from a previous vaccine reaction. I left the health department around 4:40 although I did not feel right but knowing that I had taken a Benadryl, I would hopefully be okay to make it home. By 7:15pm I felt I was having minor trouble breathing. So I took another Benadryl, and it did not seem to help by 7:40 approximately I took another Benadryl because I felt like I was suffocating and having to gasp for air and I was getting really light headed and felt like I was going to faint. My mother took me to hospital. I arrived there at approximately 8:00pm. Approximately 15-20 minutes after arriving I felt the Benadryl start working and breathing was not such a hard task. The doctor gave me a steroid pill 10mgs. (Not sure what kind, because it is not listed on my discharge paper) I was also given a 20mg Pepcid AC, I was told to take Pepcid AC if needed and to get help if the problem re-occurred and I was discharge with the diagnosis of vaccine reaction.
