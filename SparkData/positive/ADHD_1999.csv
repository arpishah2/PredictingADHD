We explained everything that had been ocurring. He was very questionable about exactly what was occuring. He examined him and recommended we take him to a Pediatric Neurologist. He also ordered an immediate blood work-up. They tested him for many substances such as lead, chromium etc. Everything came out clear. He set us up with a neurologist. He said he couldn't see our son for over a month. We were extremely distraught. We argued over the severity of what was occuring. They said it was the best they could do. So we waited. Over this period of time our son deteriorated severly. He continued twitching, jerking, spasming. He could not even walk without falling. He lost his entire memory. He was like he was in a delierium. He would just sit and stare at a blank wall. He no longer recognized anything or anyone around him. He began urinating and soiling himself on a regular basis. He basically became like a vegatable. We called the doctor and pleaded for help. We were told we must wait. That there were other sick children too. This was the most horrible, stressful, sad experience in our lives. Our son could no longer talk at all. he had no memory of anything including his father and I. He had no potty training abilities. He had no co-ordination. He could barely walk. He would just sit and stare with his mouth open. After about 3 continuous weeks of twitiching it stopped. But his condition had no improvement. He became terrifed of anything. Screaming and crying uncontrollably. After about a week wait we finally got him to the neurologist. Upon him seeing and hearing our son. He says ""why was this child not brought to my attention much sooner."" We nearly went into hysterics. Explaining all we had been through and how hard we tried to get him in. He became upset and said he wished to speak to our sons pediatrition. So we agreed. He spoke to the doctor about him recognizing this as a DPT reaction. Why was this not brought to his attention sooner to begin treatment. Our sons pediatrition; said he just wasn't sure about the DPT reaction. He said he had observed some abnormal behaviors in our son before immunization; he thought it might relate to. We found this comment rude, offensive and a deliberate move to try and cover his huge mistakes. He had never brought any concerns about our son to our attention ever. He was his pediatrition since birth. He always commended us on his growth and advancements. Nothing but positive remarks. To hear this was infuriating. The neurologist asked for immediate admittance into the hospital. We agreed to this. He was admitted to the hospital. They did an MRI and a Spinal Tap. Both of the tests came back normal. The Neurologist said that our son had aquired an aphasia for a reason still unknown. So we should get an EEG The EEg should be sleeping. This was a problem because since all this occurred our son had become extremly hyper-active, rarely sleeping, he had constant laughing seizures which lasted for up to 3 hours. He was uncontrollable. We still tried the EEG. We could not get him to settle much less sleep for the test. The results were not showing seizure activity. The neurologist recommended taking him to a psycologist for evaluation. We agreed and upon doing so both evaluations brought up a possiblity of him aquiring a rare condition called Landau Kleffner Syndrome. They believed he was still having sub-clinical seziures. Which was causing the strange behaviors now occuring hyper-activity, social withdrawl, aggressiveness, depression etc. We felt it was because of the complete loss of speech and language and memory. That caused such tremdous frustration.
