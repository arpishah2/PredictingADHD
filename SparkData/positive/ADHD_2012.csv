He received the DTap, HepB, IPV, HIB, Pneumococcal and Rotavirus vaccines all in the same day.  He had prolonged jaundice that developed immediately after his Hepatitis B vaccine in the hospital (at birth) as well.  Following these vaccines at 4.5 months old, my son could no longer bear weight on his legs, did not scooch around his crib, lost all early babbling, could not latch onto my breast to eat, would not look us in the eye, and began to lose weight.  His one eye turned in and tracking did not seem normal anymore.  I took him into a pediatric eye doctor to have his eyes checked.  He had no vision problems, but did not look at us.  He developed severe sensory problems where we could not hold him close, he did not want to touch any items and his hands stayed balled up in fists next to his ears.  He could not tolerate eating or drinking and I had to syringe formula down his mouth.  He developed severe GI problems, where he would stool liquid burning diahrrea 10 or more times per day.  He threw up constantly.  He became obsessed with paper and door springs and wheels.  I immediately sought out a lactation consultant and nutritionist for my son, and rented a hospital grade pump, but he was no longer able to be close to me or latch on correctly to nurse.  The GI doctor put patient on a special formula and Prevacid to help with ""reflux"" which did not help.  A couple months went by and we tried to introduce solids to my son, which he refused to eat.  He shook his head violently side to side.  We then were referred to facility for an evaluation for feeding therapy and an evaluation for Occupational Therapy as well at 8 months old.  He was diagnosed with Sensory Processing Disorder and we began feeding and occupational therapy twice each week.  Feeding did not get better, GI did not get better and my son only grew in his sensory problems.  As he got older more and more obsessions appeared and he became more and more disconnected from us.  He developed dark circles under his eyes and drooled excessively, soaking through shirts in a matter of minutes.  He was obsessed with wheels, spinning himself and banging his head on the walls. He did not look us in the eye.  The formerly very social child we had brought into this world was gone.  Formula had to be syringed down my son, who had to sit in a vibrating baby chair with video for distraction to syringe his formula down his mouth without him batting it away or shaking his head violently.  Each bottle took us approx 2 hours to get down, 5 times per day.  Solids were an even worse undertaking with crying, fighting, etc.  At 10 months old, I reached out for more in home occupational therapy as my son had a horrible time going to the feeding and OT at the clinic due to sensory problems.  At 11 months old, we took my son to a Holistic Pediatrician as his original Pediatrician stopped taking our insurance a few months prior.  This doctor specialized in children with ADHD, Autism, Autoimmune issues and Allergies which I highly suspected were a problem now.  We reported what had occurred with our son to our new Pediatrician.  He ran some tests and determined that patient now had all kinds of imbalances, an over growth of yeast, vitamin and mineral deficiencies that needed to be treated.  This helped our son immensely.  We switched formulas to a gluten and casein free type and this helped as well.  When we took the labs to our current local GI doctor from Dr showing all the GI overgrowths and problems, we were dismissed by our local GI.  My son was also tested for MTHFR mutation, which he did have, as do many on the spectrum.  I have the same mutation, but am not autistic.  He has a decreased ability to excrete toxins and should never have been given so many vaccines at one time.
