HE WATCHED THE NURSE GIVE HIM THE SHOTS AS HE ALWAYS HAS, EVEN FOR IV'S HE WATCHES, SO HE ISN'T SQUEEMISH BECAUSE OF THAT; HOWEVER, WHEN WE GOT TO THE CHECK-OUT WINDOW ABOUT 2 MINUTES AFTER THE SHOTS, HE SAID HE FELT DIZZY AND I TURNED AROUND TO TALK WITH HIM AND WHEN I TURNED AROUND HIS EYE WERE ROLLED BACK IN HIS HEAD AND HE WAS FALLING STRAIGHT BACK, THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO.  HE FELL VERY HARD ON HIS SHOULDERS AND THE BACK OF HIS HEAD BECAUSE HE FELL STRAIGHT BACK.  I WENT DOWN TO HIM IMMEDIATELY AND TRIED TO AROUSE HIM BUT HE WAS UNCONSCIOUS. I CALLED FOR HELP IMMEDIATELY AND YELLED THAT HE HAD PASSED OUT AND THEY CAME RUNNING.  WHEN THE NURSE GOT TO HIM HE STARTED TO RE-GAIN CONSCIOUSNESS RIGHT AFTER THAT.  HIS MOUTH DREW TO THE SIDE AND HIS EYES JUST ROLLED AROUND IN A STRANGE GAZE, AS A PERSON HAVING A SEIZURE, BUT I'M NOT SURE IF HE ACTUALLY HAD A LITTLE SEIZURE OR NOT. WHEN I MENTIONED IT TO THE NURSE, SHE DIDN'T SEEM CONCERNED. I HAVE HEARD THAT NOT ALL SEIZURES ARE VERY LONG AND EVENTFUL, ALL I KNOW IS THAT FOR HIS MOUTH TO DO WHAT IT DID WAS NOT NORMAL FOR HIM AND THAT IS WHY I MENTIONED IT TO THE NURSE THAT FIRST HELPED US.  I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE EVEN WROTE IT IN A REPORT.  I DID MENTION IT AT THE HOSPITAL ALSO.  THEY RE-EVALUATED HIM AND HIS BLOOD PRESSURE KEPT DROPPING AND HE STARTED INTO SHOCK.

THEY CALLED THE RESCUE SQUAD BECAUSE HIS PRESSURE WAS GETTING WORSE AND WHEN THEY GOT THERE THEY GAVE HIM OXYGEN AND PUT A COLLAR ON HIM AND STRAPPED HIM TO A BOARD AND TOOK HIM TO THE HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM.  WHEN HE GOT THERE THEY DID BLOOD WORK AND A CHEST X-RAY AND TRIED TO MAKE ME BELIEVE THAT HE HAD PASSED OUT FROM SEEING THE NEEDLE. THEY DIDN'T EVEN OFFER ANYTHING FOR PAIN UNTIL I ASKED, AND THEY CAME TO ME WITH DISCHARGE PAPERS FOR ME TO SIGN AND I ASKED THEM WHY THEY DIDN'T DO SOMETHING LIKE A CT SCAN ON HIS HEAD BECAUSE MOST OF HIS FALL WAS FELT BY HIS HEAD?

THEY WERE NOT EXPIRED AT THAT TIME, HOWEVER I DIDN'T THINK TO COPY THE LOT NUMBER, ETC AT THAT TIME BUT I AM SURE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE HAD TO DO THIS ON HIS RECORD.
