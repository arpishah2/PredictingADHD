Following the second innoculation, his speech did not regress further; however, his behavior changed and became significantly more of a concern. He exhibits ADHD characteristics and is currently being evaluated by a physician, for this autism spectrum disorder.

The exposure to airborne mercury in the environment through inhalation, the food chain, and other sources contributed to the cumulative mercury toxicity and was a substantial factor in causing his neurological damage. it was noted that the pt had a heightened vulnerability to suffer neurological injuries from industrial mercury as a direct result of thimerosal exposure. As a direct and proximate cause of the toxic mercury exposure to  the pt, minor male was caused to suffer serious and permanent neurological damage which included past and future mental, intellectual, development and neurological incapacity and associated learning disabilities, disorders and impairments. Additional information has been received from medical records concerning an approx 18 month old male with a history of clonus, increased reflexes and hospitalization due to dehydration who on 7/18/1991 and 9/26/1991 was vaccinated with the first and second dosed, respectively of Hib conj vaccine 3rd dose given 6/26/1992 and 4 dose given 11/1/1999. Concomitant vaccinations included the first and second doses, respectively of DPT (3rd dose given 1/26/1992), In approx Nov 1992, the pt was diagnosed with autism as his language decreased and be came unintelligible. His development was slowing in general. He was difficult to handle due to over activity and preservation behavior. On 12/16/1993, the pt was seen by a developmental pediatrician. At that time, the pts mother was concerned he could not talk, She noted he had several words, but quit talking around two years of age. This was the only loss of skills that the mother noticed. At the time of examination, he had no words although he had some immature jargoning. His overall functioning was at the 7-9 month range with characteristics of pervasive developmental disorder (PPD) noted as well as overall development delays in the mental retardation range with language skills being much lower than non language skills. A diagnosis of PPD NOS and moderate mental retardation was made. He did have some temper tantrums which took about 20 minutes to subside. On 11/9/1998, the pt was again seen by a developmental pediatrician. At that time, his mother noted that his nerves were rally bad and that he did not keep still. The pt was being treated with Ritalin. On examination, the pt was noted to be a well nourished, generally uncooperative male in no acute distress. He was preserverative. He speech showed fair to poor intelligibility. He spoke in few words to complete sentences. He had a short attention span. hyperactive and at times attention seeking. He frequently walked on his toes, was echolalic and rock and bit his nails. The pt was fairly non compliant, was inconsistent in identifying number concepts, could not identify shapes and could not draw a cross or square. A diagnosis of autism, ADHD and behavioral problems with non compliance was made. As of 4/3/01, the pt had widely variable ability, ranging from mild to moderate mental retardation to the low average range. As of 3/3/1995, the pt had profound delays in receptive and expressive language and profound delays in phonology respect to his chronological age. It was noted that pt had a articulation disorder. It was also noted that on 12/7/92 and 8/23/95 the pt was vaccianted with the first and second doses, respectively, of MMR II and the first (4/27/98), second (5/27/98) and third (3/26/99) doses, respective",,,,,,,,,N,1991-09-26,1992-11-01,402,,OTH,OTH,,,"Clonus, reflexes increased, dehydration, hospitalization.",,WAES0412USA03227,11907

In approx Oct 1989, the pt was noted to have speech delay as he was no longer saying distinct words and could only be heard to utter jargon in a sing song manner. He was also noted to have stopped developing. In approx April 1990, a diagnosis of autism was made. on 5/10/1992 the pt was hospitalized in a pediatric ward for reactive air way disease, developmental delays and to rule out pervasive developmental delay. At that time, the pt was noted to have poor speech with a vocabulary of approx 15 words. He was evaluated by a developmental pediatrician who noted that the pt appeared to be showing very stereotypical behavior consistent with Pervasive developmental delay (PPD), in particular, autism, The physician noted that the pt had a severe verbal and non verbal communication disorder with some deviant social interactions. In additional, the pt had chromosomes which were also sent for fragile X, which were negative, High resolution chromosomes that were done revealed that the pt was a 46 xy normal male by chromosome appearance. The pt also had a normal EEG and audiological evaluation. A speech evaluation concluded that the pt had a severe speech delay pattern. Discharge diagnosis included PPD, probably moderate to severe mental retardation and reactive airway disease. On 7/10/1992, the pt was seen by a developmental pediatrician who confirmed a diagnosis of PPD, but was unclear of the specific etiology of the pts developmental difficulties. On 9/15/1992 and MRI of the brain was normal. On 3/19/2001, the pt developed a seizure disorder for which he was hospitalized.

On 12/4/1998 the pt had a neuro psychology evaluation regarding the pts delays in speech and language development, and his parents concerns with respect to their difficulty in managing his behavior. It was reported by the pts parents that he had been diagnosed with ADHD and possibly depression, he was started on Ritalin which was discontinued after one day because the pts behaviors were exacerbated on it. The pts parents also reported that he had difficulty with the demands of a structured preschool setting, and difficulty in understanding how to play with other children, the pt achieved developmental milestones which were generally within normal limits, with the exception of his language milestones, and he has no set and regular schedule for sleep. The pts family history is significant for learning difficulties on his mothers side and depression and alcohol abuse in his paternal family. The pts half brother from his maternal side is reported to have ADHD. It was observed during the evaluation that the pts attention was greatly diminished with tasks beyond his level of understanding, though he was very pleased with success, smiling and clapping when able to complete tasks. it was noted that the pts cooperation was better when sitting closer to his father. It was observed that the pt had a low frustration tolerance and difficulty calming himself once he became frustrated, he communicated this in non verbal and simple verbal ways. It was reported that due to the pts low frustration tolerance and variable attention, a screening was performed rather than a complete evaluation. It was noted that the pt was able to understand spoken simple one step commands and that he did demonstrate some separation anxiety. It was noted that the pts overall development is delayed and that he is functioning in the mental retarded range with his best reasoning abilities being at a 16-18 month developmental level. The pt was observed to use single words and gestures to make his needs and wants known.
