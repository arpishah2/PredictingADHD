The subject was vaccinated with Engerix B on 23 September 1992, 02 November 1992, and 30 March 1993. On 30 March 1993 the subject received third dose of Engerix B. According to the legal complaint, at an unspecified time after vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine, the subject experienced ""serious and permanent neurological injuries"" which were ""alleged to be caused by Thimerosal."" Additionally, the subject experienced a neurodevelopmental disorder. Approximately two years after the third vaccination with Engerix B, in December 1995, the subject was diagnosed with autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. In December 1996, a diagnosis of autism was again made. In April 1998, the subject was diagnosed with mental retardation and mixed receptive-expressive language disorder. This case was assessed as medically serious by manufacturer. The following information was received on 30 March 2007 via medical records. In November 1994, the subject's pediatrician noted he exhibited a limited vocabulary for his age and had not started putting words together. According to pediatrician's notes dated 27 September 1995, the subject had been recently diagnosed with pervasive developmental disorder, and was enrolled in speech therapy at that time. He was later diagnosed with autism. On 04 December 1995, the subject underwent a comprehensive developmental pediatric evaluation. According to his mother, the subject rolled over at three months, and crawled and walked alone at 10 months. He reportedly had a ""social smile at one month, said ""mama"" at 7 months, and then it went away"". Concerns at the time of examination included short attention span and occasional aggression. Examination revealed normal extremity strength and tone. The subject was found to meet the diagnostic criteria for autism. On 06 December 1995, he underwent a psychological evaluation for problems including poor language skills and inability to initiate toilet training. Cognitive development as assessed by the Bayley Scales of Infant Development fell within the ""significantly delayed performance range of functioning"". Diagnoses included autistic disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD, predominantly hyperactive-impulsive disorder). Moderate psychosocial stressors were also noted, including problems with primary support group and inadequate educational services. A speech and language evaluation was conducted on 17 June 1996 for possible school placement. According to the speech pathologist's report, the subject exhibited language understanding at 6 to 7 month level with some skills scattered to 11 to 12 months, and expressive language skills at a 3 to 4 month level. On 31 December 1996 a developmental neuropsychosocial evaluation was conducted, resulting in confirmation of a diagnosis of autism. Receptive language skills were assessed at the 12 to 17 month level, with expressive language skills at approximately a 10 month level. The evaluating psychologist stated ""the extent of autistic behaviors is sufficiently severe to render impossible any efforts at estimating nonverbal intellectual skills"". On 20 March 1997, the subject was evaluated by a neurologist who confirmed autism with severe difficulty with language, and initiated a trial of dextromethorphan. Prozac was initiated on 21 May 1997, and upon follow up on 23 July 1997, it was noted that the subject was experiencing increased focus and eye contact. A taper from dextromethorphan was started at that time. On 17 November 1997, a pediatric neurologist expressed the impression of pervasive developmental disability compatible with autism, stating "" I find no other neurologic abnormality and did not feel that any further psychosocial testing needs to be performed.""

Notes indicated ""rule out speech delay, rule out hearing loss"". On 26 June 1998, a speech and language evaluation was conducted. results included mild delays in auditory comprehension, receptive language, expressive language, and total language with normal expressive communication skills. It was noted that the subject yelled or engaged in aggressive behavior instead of using language when frustrated. Recommendations included weekly speech therapy. On 02 July 1998, the subject underwent a developmental evaluation within the home, and demonstrated significantly delayed mental skills for his age, with language, cognitive, fine motor, sensory processing, and attending skills of specific concern. It was noted that he experienced difficulty attending to tasks and became easily frustrated. Recommendations included speech intervention and occupational and developmental therapy. An occupational therapy evaluation revealed slightly low muscle tone in the trunk and upper and lower extremities, and concerns included sensory processing and hand-eye coordination which were assessed to be ""influencing the development of age appropriate sensory motor skills"". According to progress notes dated 23 July 1998, the subject had been identified as having a speech delay by his daycare provider. In May 1999, the subject was referred for review and update of developmental assessments. Developmental testing revealed a significant mental delay with relative strengths in nonverbal problem solving/ reasoning, while tasks involving verbal comprehensive and expressive language were more difficult. The evaluated stated that ""at this point, the special education category of autism is appropriate for (subject)"". On 09 June 1999, the subject returned to his pediatrician for evaluation for evaluation of unclear speech described as ""somewhat of a speech impediment"". At that time, the subject was enrolled in speech therapy. A psychological consultation was performed on 21 July 1999 for the purpose of educational placement. He exhibited oppositional behavior at times, and was noted to initiate joint attention with adults, although he did not do so with peers. Evaluation on 23 November 1999 indicated ""loss of many developmental milestones especially expressive language"", and during the course of examination the subject was ""chaotic"" and inattention. The subject struck his mother and the examining physician several times, and attempts to control the child resulted in ""explosive behavior from the child with screaming and spitting at mother"". The evaluating physician also observed that ""lack of continuity had contributed greatly to the chaotic nature of this patient's medical record"", and recommended that the subject be assigned a single pediatric provider.

He has not had any since taking him off Augmentin.  Patient was put on Miralax for constipation.  He no longer takes this, but he still has some difficulty with stools (sometimes very large). Most of his life until probably the last 6 months we as parents had to make him go to the bathroom to have a bowel movement (we did this every night).  We recently took him off the Miralax and he will usually go by himself without telling him to go.  We have had numerous problems with patient.  Over the years the behaviors have been very severe.  He has broken windows, furniture etc.)  We find it very hard to find people who will work with him because of his behaviors.  A little over 5 years ago we started going to a Defeat Autism Now (DAN) doctor.  We now go to him about once every year or two depending on how patient is doing.  He has put patient on a number of vitamins and supplements and treatments.  Patient seems to be doing better, but we still have outbursts.  Just recently he broke the front window in my Wolkswagen with his hand.   We believe patient has severe headaches.  He is also self abusive (bites his arm and hand).  Hits his head. Over the years patient has been treated by Dr.  He is no longer in practice.  We then went to Dr., Peditrician.  He now practices in a different city, but we still go to him presently.  We also see a Dr.  We have used numerous programs, Speech, Occupational Therapy, Judevine, ABA, Hyperbarics. I am listing some of the doctors who have seen patient over the years.  1/15/08 Reviewed medical records which reveals patient experienced autoimmune disease, obsessive-compulsive disorder, encephalopathy, nutritional deficiencies, allergic gastroenteritis/colitis, bed wetting, receptive/expressive language disorder, ADHD, temper tantrums, aggression, constipation, stimming, sleep difficulties, poor interaction w/others, screaming.  Patient tx w/hyperbarics, gluten/caesin free diet, chelation, multiple meds & supplements, NIMH protocol, ST/OT. FINAL DX: autism, pervasive developmental disorder. Per 60 day follow up: He is severly austistic.  Follow-up: Gluten Free/Casein Free diet prescribed by Dr. Vitamins and supplements prescribed by Dr. Previously was on MIRALAX for quite a number of years for constipation. He no longer takes this, but he still has some difficulty with stools (sometimes very large). We feel he was unable to feel when he needed to go to the bathroom for a bowel movement while on MIRALAX, because since he has been off he sometimes goes on his own in the toilet. He never went on his own while on MIRALAX we had to make him go, unless he went on the floor. We make sure he goes at least once a day. Pt is allergic to AUGMENTIN, we found this out after he had two heat related seizures while on this medication when he was younger. Pt also had a hernia operation around 2 years of age. Follow-up: Patient is severely autistic with major deficits in language and social skills. We have seen major behavior problems over the years, but over the last few years we have seen more violent behaviors including kicking and punching out (with his fists) sheet rock walls, glass windows including all 3 window shields in our cars. We continue to see more aggression towards people (parents, caregivers, teachers, students (hitting, punching, biting, kicking). He will never be able to live alone. He will always need a caregiver.",,,,,,,,Y,N,1992-03-27,1992-04-01,5,"I am forwarding you a packet of laboratory testing that has been done recently.
