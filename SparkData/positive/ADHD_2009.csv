They told us he needed shots, I asked them if we could reschedule the vaccinations, and they told me that it would be fine to give them to him.  Approximately 7 days following his June vaccinations in 2007, he changed completely. He no longer made eye contact with anyone, went back to babbling like an infant again and seemed to lose his motor skills. He became very clumsy. Not thinking that there would be a tie to the shots, we took him to his old pediatricians office, and they thought nothing of it.  So we figured that we just needed to do more work with him. In November of 2007, when things did not get any better we found a new pediatrician. He recommended speech therapy, behavior therapy and a hearing test.

Beginning in 1998, the patient was treated five times in the emergency room for a variety of accidents that a respondent's expert said were the results of impulsive behavior and thus evidence of ADHD. A Special Masters ruled a petition alleging that thimerosal in vaccines, including the RECOMBIVAX vaccine (manufacturer unknown), caused attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), saying symptoms that may not have been recognized at the time still trigger the Vaccine Act's 36-month statue of limitations. A Chief Special Master said that the experts agreed that the ""first symptoms of manifestations"" of the patient's ADHD was at the latest by 03-Nov-2001 when he was 4 years and 6 months old, which required a filing by 03-Nov-2004, under the statue. The Chief Special Master noted that the binding decision regarding onset timing, allows ""retrospective"" analysis even when such analysis identifies as the ""first symptoms or manifestations"" some innocuous episode in a child's health. The chief special master pointed out, the manifestation was ""blinking."" The undersigned disagrees with the petitioner's interpretation and finds that the correct reading is that the critical determination is focused solely upon when the first symptoms or manifestation of onset occurred.
