The annual follow-up information obtained on 4/16/02 states that the pt is a vaccine injured child. At the age of four months pt experienced a status epilepticus grand mal seizure 8 1/2 hours after his DTP vaccine. This resulted in permanent brain damage. The complete extent of this damage was not realized until pt aged and experienced developmental delays. Pt's vaccine damage from teh DTP vaccine resulted in a seizure disorder. His seizures remained uncontrolled by medications. He also has autism, moderate mental retardation, ADHD, ETC as a result of this DTP vaccine. Pt has a small seizure 5 days after these injections since he did have an existing seizure disorder. This may have been coincidental. Pt's hyperactivity became so out of control after this time that he had to go on medications in Sept 1993 to help controlhis hyperactivity Aggression, impulsiveness, etc. We do not know if the vaccines may have had an effect on his hyperactivity increase. As of April 2002, pt remains  on medications for his hyperactivity and also remains on medications for his seizure.",,,,,,,,,U,1993-06-29,1993-07-04,5,2EEG's & blood test & urinalysis & electrolytes;,UNK,UNK,depakote sprinkles;ritalin;carnitor;,NONE,"sx disorder resulting from vax rxn @ 4mo;also has autism, ADHD mental retardation",,,2235
